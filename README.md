# [OUTDATED]
These bots are no longer used on HTC. They've been ported over to python by other developers and can be found at the official group for HTC's sister server, [HTwins STEM](https://github.com/HTSTEM). If you want to use these bots, you should really just use the python ports instead. They're more stable and actively developed.
